[0.2.0]

Various visual enhancements, primitve additions and CSS variables in support of more flexible theming.

To prep for shadcn registry components, utilities and variables are no longer built with a
Tailwind prefix (`vkui`). A scoped export still exists in the package for instances where style isolation matters.

- Added: TW4 utilities for button sizing
- Change: `AudioClientHelper` renamed to `PipecatAppBase`.
  - Now accepts both React Node children as well as a functional list for prop injection. If passing renderables, client methods can be accessed directly on the context's client via Pipecat React hooks (e.g. `usePipecatClient`).
  - Added `noThemeProvider` prop to optionally disable theme provider wrapping.
  - Made connection handlers (`handleConnect`, `handleDisconnect`) compatible with both sync and async functions.
  - Enhanced error handling and loading states for better developer experience.
  - Returns the `client` object in child props.

- Fixed: `tailwind-merge` needs extensions for custom shadow-\* class names, which have no been applied.
- Fixed: CSS nits to address border overlap for button groups when in dark mode.
- Fixed: User audio control no longer shrinks when loading

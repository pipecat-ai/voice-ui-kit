component: ClientStatus
---

The ClientStatus component displays the connection status of both the client and agent (bot) in a structured data list format. It automatically integrates with the Pipecat Client SDK to show real-time connection states.

<LiveComponent language="tsx">
{`
  import { ClientStatus } from "@pipecat-ai/voice-ui-kit";

  <ClientStatus />
`}
</LiveComponent>

<TypeTable
  className="text-sm"
  type={{
    classNames: {
      description: "Custom CSS classes for different parts of the component",
      type: "{ container?: string; key?: string; value?: string; agentValue?: string; clientValue?: string; }",
      required: false,
      default: "{}",
    },
    noAgentState: {
      description: "Hide the agent/bot status display",
      type: "boolean",
      required: false,
      default: "false",
    },
    noClientState: {
      description: "Hide the client status display",
      type: "boolean",
      required: false,
      default: "false",
    },
  }}
/>

### ClientStatusComponent

The `ClientStatusComponent` is a headless variant that accepts transport state as a prop. This allows you to use it with any state management solution.

<LiveComponent language="tsx" noInline>
{`
  import { ClientStatusComponent } from "@pipecat-ai/voice-ui-kit";

function Demo() {
return (
<ClientStatusComponent transportState="connected" />
);
}

render(<Demo />);
`}

</LiveComponent>

<TypeTable
  className="text-sm"
  type={{
    className: {
      description: "Additional CSS classes to apply",
      type: "string",
      required: false,
      default: "undefined",
    },
    transportState: {
      description: "The current transport state to display",
      type: "string | null",
      required: false,
      default: "undefined",
    },
  }}
/>

## Connection States

The component displays the following connection states:

- **initialized** - Client is initialized but not connected
- **initializing** - Client is being initialized
- **authenticating** - Client is authenticating with the server
- **authenticated** - Client has been authenticated
- **connecting** - Client is connecting to the session
- **connected** - Client is connected to the session
- **ready** - Agent is ready and connected
- **disconnected** - Client or agent is disconnected
- **disconnecting** - Client is disconnecting
- **error** - An error occurred

States are color-coded:

- **Active states** (connected, ready): Green text
- **Error state**: Red text
- **Disconnected state**: Muted text
- **Connecting states**: Animated pulse effect with spinner

## Integration

The connected `ClientStatus` component uses hooks from the Pipecat Client React SDK:

- `usePipecatClientTransportState` - Gets the current transport state
- `useRTVIClientEvent` - Listens for bot connection events

This means it must be used within a `PipecatClientProvider` context to function properly.
